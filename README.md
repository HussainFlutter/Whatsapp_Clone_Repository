## Known Limitations  

While this project replicates many of WhatsApp's core features, there are some **small imperfections**:  

- Certain edge cases may not be fully handled in real-time messaging or media sharing.  
- UI transitions and animations could use further optimization for a smoother experience.  
- Some status or message updates may experience slight delays under specific network conditions.  
- Advanced features like end-to-end encryption and calling are not yet implemented.  

These imperfections do not significantly impact the app's functionality but highlight areas for future improvements.
